# xPlot ðŸ“ˆ

xPlot is a Python/Streamlit based data explorer to plot data from files for analysis.
It uses a WebUI powered by the Streamlit library, and plotting by the Plotly Library.
Data is handled and party manipulated by Pandas and Numpy.

## Installation

<br>`install.bat` is a batch file that allows the user to select from 2 installation choices.
- **Option [1]: Install Python 3.9.5, Paths, Dependancies and Launch xPlot**
<br>Using option [1] will launch a powershell script to install Python 3.9.5, all the dependencies required by xPlot and then launch the tool in a web browser
- **Option [2]: Install Dependancies and Launch xPlot**
<br>Using option [2] will bypass the python installation and just install all the dependencies (presuming it is installed and has the correct paths) required by xPlot and then launch the tool in a web browser.
<br>Once installtion is complete the tool will already be launched, and can be relaunched using `xPlot.bat`
